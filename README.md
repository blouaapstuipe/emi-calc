## EMI-calc

Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT

### Configuring the application

As a proof of concept, I made the maximum loan duration configurable. You can change the 
value by editing /resources/application.yaml

### Running the application

1. Maven clean install
2. Navigate to the /frontend folder
3. terminal command: ng serve
4. Run Main.java (package nl.someorg) or run the fat jar in /target
5. point your browser to http://localhost:4200/calc/emi
6. Happy obsessing over the amount of interest paid!
